# RAG Textbook Assistant Implementation Guide

## Overview

This project now includes a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that allows students to upload PDF textbooks and chat with an AI that understands the content. The system processes everything locally in the browser for maximum privacy and offline capability.

## What We Built

### üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**
- **PDF Processing**: Uses pdfjs-dist to parse PDF files and extract text
- **Text Chunking**: Intelligent chunking with overlap and section detection
- **Local Embeddings**: transformers.js with MiniLM model for vector embeddings
- **Vector Search**: Hybrid search combining cosine similarity and BM25
- **MMR Diversity**: Maximum Marginal Relevance for better answer variety
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB via Dexie for persistent storage

### üìö **Features**
- Upload PDF textbooks (up to 100MB)
- Automatic text extraction and chunking
- Local vector embedding generation
- Subject-specific knowledge bases
- Intelligent question answering with citations
- Export/import database functionality
- Progress tracking for large files

### üîí **Privacy & Security**
- **100% Local Processing**: No data leaves your browser
- **No External APIs**: All AI processing happens locally
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet once models are loaded
- **Data Ownership**: Your textbooks, your data, your control

### **Key Technologies**
- **PDF.js**: PDF parsing and text extraction
- **Transformers.js**: Local ML model inference
- **Dexie**: IndexedDB wrapper for easier database operations
- **Elasticlunr**: BM25 text search implementation
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern UI framework

### **Data Flow**
1. **Upload**: PDF ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Chunk ‚Üí Embed ‚Üí Store
2. **Query**: Question ‚Üí Embed ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Retrieve ‚Üí Compose ‚Üí Answer
3. **Storage**: IndexedDB with tables for books, chunks, embeddings, and chat history

## Usage Guide

### **1. Uploading Textbooks**
- Navigate to the "RAG Assistant" section
- Select "Upload Textbook" tab
- Drag & drop or browse for PDF files
- Enter book title and select subject
- Wait for processing (shows progress for each stage)

### **2. Chatting with AI**
- Go to "Chat with AI" tab
- Select the subject you want to ask about
- Type your question naturally
- Get answers with page citations
- Ask follow-up questions in the same session

### **3. Managing Knowledge Base**
- Use "Knowledge Base" tab to view all uploaded books
- See processing status, file sizes, and page counts
- Delete books if needed
- Export/import your database for backup

## Performance Considerations

### **Storage Requirements**
- **Per Book (300-400 pages)**:
  - Text chunks: ~10-20MB
  - Embeddings: ~3MB
  - Total: ~15-25MB per book
- **Browser Limits**: IndexedDB typically supports 50MB+ per origin

### **Processing Time**
- **Small books (50-100 pages)**: 2-5 minutes
- **Medium books (200-300 pages)**: 5-15 minutes
- **Large books (400+ pages)**: 15-30 minutes

### **Memory Usage**
- **Model loading**: ~30-60MB (cached after first use)
- **Runtime memory**: Varies with book size and chunk count
- **Recommendation**: Close other tabs during processing

## Advanced Features

### **Hybrid Search**
- **Cosine Similarity**: Semantic vector search
- **BM25**: Traditional text relevance scoring
- **Combined Scoring**: Weighted combination for best results
- **MMR Diversity**: Prevents repetitive answers

### **Smart Chunking**
- **Intelligent Splitting**: Respects section boundaries
- **Overlap Management**: Maintains context between chunks
- **Size Optimization**: Target 900 words with 150-word overlap
- **Section Detection**: Identifies headings and chapter markers

### **Answer Composition**
- **Query Type Detection**: Automatically identifies question types
- **Contextual Responses**: Tailors answers based on question format
- **Source Citations**: Provides page numbers and relevance scores
- **Confidence Scoring**: Indicates answer reliability

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **PDF Processing Fails**
- Ensure PDF is text-based (not scanned images)
- Check file size (max 100MB)
- Try with a smaller PDF first
- Check browser console for errors

#### **Slow Processing**
- Close other browser tabs
- Ensure stable internet connection (for initial model download)
- Consider processing during off-peak hours
- Large books naturally take longer

#### **Memory Errors**
- Refresh browser and try again
- Process books one at a time
- Check available system memory
- Use a different browser if issues persist

#### **Model Loading Issues**
- Check internet connection
- Clear browser cache
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure browser supports WebAssembly

### **Browser Compatibility**
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support (iOS 14.5+)
- **Mobile**: Limited due to memory constraints

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**

- **Advanced Search**: Filters by date, author, topic
- **Study Analytics**: Track which topics you ask about most
- **Collaborative Features**: Share knowledge bases with classmates
- **Mobile Optimization**: Better mobile experience

### **Technical Improvements**
- **Model Quantization**: Smaller, faster models
- **Streaming Processing**: Real-time progress updates
- **Background Processing**: Continue working while processing
- **Smart Caching**: Optimize repeated queries

## Integration with Existing System

- **No Cloud Uploads**: PDFs never leave your device
- **Encrypted Storage**: IndexedDB provides basic data protection
- **User Control**: Full control over data deletion

### **Model Security**
- **Open Source Models**: All AI models are open source
- **No Training Data**: Models don't learn from your content
- **Version Control**: Specific model versions for reproducibility

## Support & Maintenance

### **Regular Tasks**
- **Database Cleanup**: Remove old books periodically

## Conclusion

This RAG system provides a powerful, private, and efficient way to interact with your textbook content. It transforms static PDFs into intelligent, searchable knowledge bases that can answer questions, provide explanations, and help with exam preparation.

The system is designed to be:
- **User-Friendly**: Simple upload and chat interface
- **Privacy-First**: Everything stays local
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple subjects and books
- **Reliable**: Robust error handling and progress tracking

Start by uploading a small textbook to test the system, then gradually add more materials as you become comfortable with the interface and processing times.
